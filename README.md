Image Generation using Pre-Trained Models (Stable Diffusion /DALL.E)
# Image Generation using Pre-trained Models

This project is a beginner-friendly Generative AI mini project where I generated images from text prompts using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model in Google Colab.

## What I did
- Generated images using text prompts (prompt-to-image)
- Used GPU in Google Colab for faster image generation
- Saved the generated output images
- Uploaded the notebook and outputs to GitHub

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Stable Diffusion (Diffusers library)
- PyTorch
- GitHub

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all the cells step by step.

## Sample Output
